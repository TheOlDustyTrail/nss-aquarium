                        fish to harvest. They live about 5,000 neters below the sea.
                        Since they are used to the dark you will see them in shalow water at night.

                        Keep an eye out for the Frogfish! This fish takes multiple colors they blend in well with the
                        surroundings and dont use tails to swim! They use jet propulsion!

                        out for this guy! The lion fish is a beautiful fish but venomus. Proceed
                        with
                        caution when approching this fish.

            <h2 class="sideHeader">Keeping Clean</h2>
            <p class="cleaningInfo">Keeping tanks clean is very important when having fish. Chaning the water
                and keeing
                the
                gravel is essential.
                Turn off the filter and take it out. Scrub the filter and also the casing that holds the filter.
                Don't
                over
                feed the fish. They only should be fed what they consume in 2 minutes. The extra food will be no
                good
                and
                cause a mess! keeping the tank out of direct sunlight is a good way to keep clean.</p>
